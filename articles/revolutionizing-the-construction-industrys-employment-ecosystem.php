          <p><em>Bettamint instils an entrepreneurial mindset, equipping workers with tools and resources for self-reliance and resilience.</em></p>
          <p>The Indian construction industry faces significant challenges when it comes to managing the informal workforce. Finding suitable labour for construction sites, maintaining their database, calculating wages, tracking attendance, and assessing job performance are just a few of the hurdles that companies encounter. These challenges can result in delays, cost overruns, and missed opportunities for growth.</p>
          <p>Enter Bettamint, an early-stage startup that is revolutionizing the digital employment ecosystem for informal workers in the construction industry. By adopting an innovative approach, Bettamint empowers construction companies to enhance their productivity. Through the platform, construction companies can hire, time track and pay their daily wage workforce. This fosters a performance-driven culture that benefits both the workers and the company.</p>
          <p>In a freewheeling interview with Opportunity India, Kezya De Braganca, Founder, explains how her innovative start-up connects construction companies with reliable workers through its verified data base, effectively addressing the challenge of workforce shortages.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>How does Bettamint function as a digital employment ecosystem for construction industry informal workers?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Kezya De Braganca:</strong> Bettamintâ€™s digital tools empower construction companies to set productivity targets, offering real-time feedback and incentives to motivate workers. This cultivates a performance-driven culture, benefiting both workers and the company. Streamlining data collection and management, Bettamint digitises workforce information, ensuring compliance with labour regulations and eliminating manual processes. Addressing workforce shortage challenges, Bettamint's verified worker database connects companies with reliable workers, revolutionising workforce organisation. Workers optimise income, expand employability, and gain autonomy, with transparent earnings and project records. The platform opens access to financial products and services, previously unavailable to informal workers. Bettamint supports workers in thriving in the digital economy, fostering inclusivity and equity<strong>.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>How does Bettamint benefit construction companies in India, and what value does it bring to the industry?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Kezya De Braganca: </strong>The disconnection between meticulously crafted construction contracts and unpredictable on-site execution is a reality. Construction companies invest heavily in materials, equipment, and software, but human labour remains the most unpredictable aspect. Thousands of workers perform tasks in small increments, making it challenging to determine daily attendance and individual productivity. This uncertainty hampers decision-making, cost control, and reputation building. Enter Bettamint, the solution. We professionalise workforce sourcing and management, streamlining manpower operations for construction companies. We ensure the right people are available and track their productivity in real time. These insights enable informed decisions, project progress tracking, and prompt resolution of workforce-related issues. With a skilled and reliable workforce, companies consistently deliver projects on time, meet client expectations, and enhance their brand image and bottom line.</p>
          <p><strong>As an early-stage startup, what challenges have you faced in developing Bettamint, and how have you overcome them?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Kezya De Braganca: </strong>As an early-stage startup, developing Bettamint has brought challenges that have fuelled growth and learning. We prioritized simplicity and usability to design an application for an audience with literacy challenges, refining it through iterative development and collaboration. Building our initial team required careful consideration, attracting skilled individuals who share our passion. Developing a unique product without precedent involved involving customers as product managers, gathering feedback, and refining to meet their needs. Securing our first paying customer was vital, achieved by creating a minimum viable product addressing their critical problem. Managing a remote team meant establishing clear communication channels and recognizing individual contributions. Balancing long-term vision with short-term goals, we prioritised and aligned our resources. As a self-financed company, we prioritised profitability for stability and sustainability. Embracing optimism, taking calculated risks, and persevering through setbacks proved valuable. The journey of entrepreneurship allows us to leave a lasting impression and improve lives. Embracing challenges has led to personal and professional growth, fuelling our commitment to the mission and optimism for the future of Bettamint.</p>
          <p><strong>What sets Bettamint apart from other construction technology startups in the market, and what competitive advantage does it have?</strong></p>

This has helped the platform gain a significant market presence and reach over 300,000 workers through direct networks, validating a real market need.The company aims to grow its customer base and foster engagement by creating an ecosystem value and leveraging billions of proprietary data points. This approach enhances customer retention and loyalty, providing a competitive advantage. Bettamint also plays a vital role in bridging the gap between construction companies and their informal workers, serving as an ally to other construction technology companies. By connecting these essential industry components, Bettamint adds value to both sides and promotes collaboration among stakeholders driving innovation in the industry.</p>

          <p><strong>What are the potential risks and challenges that Bettamint may face as it continues to grow and scale in the coming years?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Kezya De Braganca: </strong>The market for digital employment ecosystems is highly dynamic and competitive, but we differentiate ourselves through continuous innovation, unique value propositions, and exceptional user experiences. Maintaining a robust and scalable technological infrastructure is crucial as we invest in technology, security measures, and infrastructure to handle increased user activity. Safeguarding user data and ensuring privacy is a top priority, requiring continuous assessment, enhancement of data protection measures, and compliance with relevant regulations.
