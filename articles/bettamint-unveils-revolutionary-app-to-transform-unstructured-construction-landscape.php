              comprehensive digital environment ensuring that both builders and their frontline

              labour shortages, low productivity, high attrition and unpredictable quality. We want
              to solve this problem in an inclusive way where we empower millions of informal
              construction workers by enhancing their skills, reach, employability, earnings and
              quality of life; transforming individual workers to highly engaged, actively
              contributing, well incentivised participants in the project. We are creating irresistible
              value for every stakeholder, so that we can propel the industry forward.”</p>

              within just two months of its launch, and is designed to tackle the complexities
              construction companies face in efficiently sourcing and managing their informal labour force. Bettamint offers builders a seamless interface to digitize their workforce
              operations while also reaping the benefits of increased productivity, improved quality,
              reduced attrition, and enhanced project timelines. </p>
            <p> Reflecting on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prestigeconstructions.com/">Prestige Group’s</a> construction arm: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.k2kinfra.net/">K2K Infrastructure's</a> commitment,
              Noorul Ameen, Chief Executive Officer at K2K Infrastructure India Pvt. Ltd,
              remarked, "Throughout our journey at K2K Infrastructure, our dedication to elevating

              stands tall today. Our mission has always been to raise the bar for industry
              standards and to prioritize the well-being and skill development of our workers.
              Bettamint seamlessly aligns with this vision. Its innovative solution not only
              streamline our operations but also empower our informal workforce with tools and
              opportunities previously out of reach. In partnering with Bettamint, we are not just
              embracing technology, but we're also taking a significant step towards nurturing
              talent and setting new benchmarks for the entire construction landscape.” </p>
            <p> Highlighting the product's long-term vision, Kezya De Bragança articulated, "We
              humbly stand at the frontiers of a new wave of unprecedented digital transformation
              and the more we develop the product, the more we realise the enormity of our
              opportunity to add value. We feel privileged to be in service of the industry; by aiding
              workers in building authenticated records of their experience and earnings, we're
              creating the largest most extensive, trusted repository of invaluable data for a
              demographic that until now, has been scarcely understood. This data allows us to
              usher in host of digital products and services that is currently out of reach to the
              entire population such as affordable finance, early salary, education, healthcare, skill
              development, and welfare services, fundamentally enhancing their lives. We envision
              an industry where workers excel in skills, safety protocols, quality standards, and
              professional ethics, incentivised by unparalleled benefits and rewards. As we move
              towards this reality, we also streamline manpower operations for construction
              companies, enhancing the quality of their output and establishing a more predictable
              project pace. In essence, we are not just fueling professionalism in the industry but
              also improving the quality of lives of construction workers moving towards a shared
              future where everyone wins. While India remains our primary focus at present, the
              scalability and adaptability of our model primes us for potential expansion into similar
              demographics in other emerging economies."</p>
