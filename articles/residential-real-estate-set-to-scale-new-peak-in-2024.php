            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Feconomictimes.indiatimes.com%2Ftopic%2Fresidential-real-estate">Residential real estate</a> sector witnessed yet another stellar year with

            <p>In the last couple of years, the residential market has come out of a long
              
              period stagnancy in prices. Attracted by the prospect of capital gains, the
              
              residential market is currently witnessing huge participation from investors,
              
              according to international property consultant Cushman & Wakefield.</p>
            <p>“Investors are displaying confidence by channelling funds into new launches and land transactions, indicating
              
              sustained interest and optimism in the Residential <a target="_blank" href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Feconomictimes.indiatimes.com%2Ftopic%2Freal-estate">real estate</a> sector. Although, not expected to undergo radical
              
              fluctuations, the market is anticipated to remain stable moving forward,” said Shalin Raina, Managing Director,
              
              Residential Services, India.</p>
            <p>In NCR, areas like Dwarka Expressway, New Gurugram, and South of Gurugram (Sohna), SPR residential
              
              demand has seen a significant upswing, driven by keen interest from buyers towards mid-housing and massive
              
              infrastructure development in these locations.</p>
            <p>The spotlight on the mid-housing sector has been particularly noteworthy, reflecting the discerning preferences
              
              of homebuyers seeking the perfect blend of affordability and quality living,” said Pradeep Aggarwal, Founder & Chairman, Signature Global (India) Ltd.</p>
            <p>The successful transaction of 82,612 housing units during the July-September quarter, showcasing a remarkable
              
              12% YoY increase, marks a significant milestone for the industry as a whole.</p>
            <p>“As we reflect on a transformative year for the real estate sector, witnessing an unprecedented surge in the
              
              demand for luxury homes, TARC Limited stands at the forefront of this paradigm shift. At TARC, our commitment
              
              to providing an enriching living experience is unwavering. Our upcoming projects in Delhi and Gurgaon redefine
              
              luxury living, integrating amenities that cater to the holistic well-being of our residents,” said Amar Sarin,CEO &
              
              MD of TARC Ltd.</p>
            <p>Parvinder Singh, Chief Executive Officer, Trident <a target="_blank" href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Feconomictimes.indiatimes.com%2Ftopic%2Frealty">Realty</a> said the real estate sector in 2023 has seen a significant
              
              shift in investor and homebuyer sentiments, which has played a crucial role in shaping its growth trajectory.</p>
            <p>“The focus has shifted towards luxury housing, independent floors, plotted development, and the growth of tier 2
              
              cities, which have redefined the optics of the sector, leading to a robust year ahead,” Singh said</p>
            <p>One of the noteworthy trends has been the increased demand for premium and luxury residential properties in
              
              tier 2 cities, reflecting the growing aspirational living in non-metros. Homebuyers now prefer investing in well-
              
              planned tier 2 cities, leading to a healthy demand for premium and luxury housing in new markets.</p>
            <p>“The market has experienced a surge in prospective buyers eagerly seeking high-end flats ranging from Rs 2
              
              crore to Rs 100 crore. This unexpected demand has resulted in builders swiftly selling entire projects, with
              
              developers employing innovative strategies to manage the overwhelming expressions of interest compared to the
              
              available number of flats,” said Aman Sarin, Director & Chief Executive Officer, Anant Raj Limited.</p>
            <p>Factors contributing to this positive trajectory include the country's high economic growth, improved consumer
              
              trust in the sector, and the noteworthy success of reputable players gaining maximum market share. The market
              
              is also well recognizing the execution capabilities of developers.</p>
            <p>“Sales across all price brackets including luxury properties have surpassed the 2022 numbers overcoming all
              
              apprehensions related to the likely adverse impact on demand from the hike in interest rates on home loans and
              
              a surge in <a target="_blank" href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Feconomictimes.indiatimes.com%2Ftopic%2Fproperty-prices">property prices</a>. Gurugram has been one of the brightest markets in terms of both sales and capital
              
              appreciation perspective. Rapid infrastructure development like Central Peripheral Road, Dwarka Expressway
              
              have played a huge part in it,” said Mohit Jain, Managing Director, Krisumi Corporation.</p>
            <p>Reports indicated a surge in the Mumbai real estate market, where mid-segment home sales outpaced affordable
              
              housing, signifying a distinctive shift in homebuyer preferences. This shift underscores a rising demand for top
              
              quality communities along with increased levels of focus in post hand-over living experience.</p>
            <p>“The evolving residential development market in NCR and MMR demonstrates an increased need for top-quality,
              
              on-time developments providing a community of joyful living. This trend seamlessly aligns with NeoLiv's vision of
              
              re-igniting the home-owning and living experiences,” said Mohit Malhotra, Founder & CEO, NeoLiv.</p>
            <p>In 2023, the real estate landscape underwent a significant transformation, witnessing a shift towards luxury
              
              housing.</p>
            <p>“The upcoming residential areas of Golf Course Extension Road and Dwarka Expressway have emerged as prominent destinations for premium residential projects. Ongoing infrastructure development and urban planning
              
              initiatives have further enhanced the appeal of these areas. As disposable incomes rise and the cohort of high-
              
              net-worth individuals expands, these trends are poised to define the real estate landscape in 2024,” said Vivek
              
              Singhal, CEO, Smartworld Developers.</p>
            <p>The shift towards tier 2 cities is not only spurred by aspirational living but also infra upgradation, seamless
              
              connectivity, and supply of luxury projects catering to the demand of homebuyers. The booming property market
              
              in tier 2 cities sets the stage for a promising 2024.</p>
            <p>"Consumers are opting for luxurious and modern spaces beyond the metros which pushed developers to respond
              
              with offerings that meet these expectations. The strategic expansion into non-metro markets in 2023 showcased
              
              the adaptability of the real estate sector, and the coming year promises even more exciting developments,” said
              
              Amrita Gupta, Director of Manglam Group and Founder President of CREDAI Rajasthan Women's Wing.</p>
            <p>Cities like Jaipur, Udaipur, Chandigarh, Goa, Surat, Vadodara are now emerging with their own unique economic
              
              identities, presenting a promising prospect for growth and development.</p>
            <p>“The rise of villas in Tier II cities is driven by a combination of urbanization, improved connectivity, affordability,
              
              and the desire for a higher quality of life. The trend will also positively impact the local economy through job
              
              creation, infrastructure development, and the growth of ancillary services,” said Yashank Wason, Managing
              
              Director, Royal Green Realty.</p>
            <p>The demand for luxury real estate and holiday homes is expected to sustain its upward trajectory. Homebuyers
              
              are increasingly seeking opulence coupled with global design and décor exposure for an exquisite living
              
              experience. The discerning tastes of the NRI market further contribute to the positive outlook for the industry.</p>
            <p>“The holiday home segment, in particular, presents exciting opportunities for growth in the coming year and we
              
              foresee Goa maintaining its spotlight. Driven by its unique blend of scenic beauty, cultural richness, and the
              
              growing trend of individuals seeking a second home for leisure and relaxation,” said Aditya Kushwaha,
              
              CEO&Director, Axis Ecorp.</p>
            <p>The Indian construction industry is set for a massive leap in 2024, and with it the need for a larger, well supported
              
              workforce.</p>
            <p>“Facing a 400% annual turnover rate and persistent labour shortages, it’s clear that the construction industry
              
              requires an overhaul of its approach to workforce management. Fair wages, skill building, safe working and clean
              
              living conditions, and job security are not just perks, but necessities to make the industry a sought-after place to
              
              work,” said Kezya D Braganca, founder, <a href="https://bettamint.com">Bettamint</a> , a construction technology company.</p>
            <p>Prashant Rao, Managing Director, Poulomi Estates, a Hyderabad based real estate developer said government
              
              initiatives, including infrastructure projects and improved internal roads to alleviate traffic, played a pivotal role in
              
              the growth of sector.</p>
            <p>“Simultaneously, there was a heightened realization among people about the importance of spacious homes,
              
              leading to a resurgence in real estate investments. This transformative year saw the emergence of a new
              
              housing segment in Hyderabad—the premium, ultra-rich, or large-format apartment category,” said Rao.</p>
