                <p>This data-driven approach creates a high-trust environment, benefiting workers and builders alike.</p>

                <p> Kezya De Braganca, founder of Bettamint, envisions a transformative journey for the construction industry. Over the next two years, Bettamint’s innovative app aims to break down traditional barriers between formal entities and informal workers, setting industry-wide benchmarks for quality and productivity. This shift will not only accelerate construction but also provide informal workers with access to skill development and financial stability, reshaping the socio-economic landscape of the industry. Bettamint’s long-term vision involves improving the quality of life for construction workers by providing access to essential services such as finance, education, healthcare, and skill development. This data-driven approach creates a high-trust environment, benefiting workers and builders alike.</p>
                <p> While initially focusing on India, Bettamint plans to expand into other emerging economies. Their scalable platform and adaptability make this expansion feasible, presenting significant growth opportunities and the potential for a meaningful impact on the construction industry globally. In an exclusive chat with Braganca:</p>
                <h3> Can you elaborate on how this innovative app is going to transform the construction industry’s engagement with informal workers in next two years?</h3>
                <p>The mass adoption of our digital tools will dissolve traditional barriers between formal entities and the vast informal workforce. We will establish industry wide benchmarks in quality, productivity and ethics that can be rated and rewarded creating workforce predictability, accelerating the pace of construction for builders. Meanwhile, workers will have access to skill development, job discovery supplemented by work and earning records, unlocking newer paths to financial stability and inclusion. It will no longer be only about building structures anymore, but constructing a new socio-economic reality that will fuel this vibrant industry from the ground up.</p>

                <h3> The press release mentions early revenues and self-funded growth within just two months. Could you share some insights into the key factors driving Bettamint’s rapid success and its financial sustainability strategy?</h3>

                <p>Bettamint’s early success is a synergy of deep industry insights, addressing a glaring market need, and a relentless focus on building a user-centric solution. Our grounding in empirical research and vast construction experience has allowed us to craft a product that resolves significant industry pain points. As a self-funded entity, our fiscal resilience comes from maintaining robust unit economics and leveraging our growing revenues to reinvest in R&D, product development and expansion ensuring long-term viability and scalability.</p>
                <h3>It’s impressive to see support from industry leaders like K2K Infrastructure. How does Bettamint align with their commitment to workforce development, and what specific benefits have they experienced since adopting your platform?</h3>

                <p>We’ve seen all our early customers share a profound commitment to elevating industry standards and solving prevailing issues collaboratively. We align perfectly with their dedication to workforce development, refining administrative processes and establishing workforce stability. Our platform has helped companies free up hours of repetitive work every day, improving transparency and progress tracking while removing the hassle of extensive report generation. All collaborators are plugged into the same real time data, simplifying every facet of manpower administration on construction sites – from identity verification to attendance protocols, progress tracking, issue logging, payroll management, and compliance reporting eliminating the need for pen, paper or complex spreadsheets.</p>

                <h3> You mentioned Bettamint’s long-term vision of improving the quality of life for construction workers. Can you provide examples of the digital products and services you plan to introduce to enhance their well-being and how this benefits both workers and construction companies? </h3>

                <p> Bettamint leverages key social, financial, and professional insights of an overlooked demographic, opening doors to crucial services like affordable finance, education, healthcare, skill development and welfare services fundamentally enhancing their lives. </p>

                <p>Consider the cash paid worker, with no paper trail of his income. He is unable to access credit. By simply recording his attendance with Bettamint he is empowered with tangible proof of his earnings and the opportunity to access affordable credit. Our data-driven approach creates a high-trust environment, rewarding punctuality, productivity, and reliability, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem where both workers and builders can thrive together.</p>

                <h3> Bettamint is initially focusing on India, but you mentioned scalability. Could you share your plans for expansion into other emerging economies and the challenges and opportunities you foresee in this journey? </h3>

                <p>Bettamint’s initial focus on a market like India is strategic, allowing us to refine our platform in a familiar yet large, complex and dynamic market. Our solution is inherently scalable and is designed to require minimal adaptation, making seamless expansion into newer markets quick and economical. We’re actively researching varying construction ecosystems, regulatory landscapes, and market needs in regions like UAE, Southeast Asia, and beyond. Adapting to these diverse ecosystems and forging strong partnerships with local industry leaders will be crucial. The vast potential in these emerging markets, combined with our platform’s versatility, presents enormous opportunities for growth and meaningful impact.</p>
