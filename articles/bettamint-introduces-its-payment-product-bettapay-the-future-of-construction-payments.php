            <p>Bangalore, India – February 8th 2024: In a significant move to modernize construction payments, Bettamint is proud to announce the launch of Bettapay. This groundbreaking payment solution is engineered to simplify and precision-target construction-linked payments, offering a smarter way to manage financial transactions in the construction sector. </p>
            <p>Bettapay is uniquely designed to cater to the nuanced requirements of the construction industry. It can synchronize payments with specific project parameters such as RA bill measurements, debit notes, worker attendance for wage payments, and even rewards and incentives for completing time-sensitive tasks. This ensures that payments are not only precise and timely but also relevant, accurately reflecting the actual work done.
            </p>
            <p>By adopting Bettapay, developers and contractors can significantly reduce the administrative burden associated with authenticating, billing and recording field payments. With powerful digital ledgers that not just cut down operational costs but also help avert cost overruns, measurement fraud, rework costs and project delays - all common pain points in the industry. This system provides an unprecedented level of control and transparency in financial management, enabling companies to maintain tighter budget control, minimise risks and protect shrinking builder margins.
            </p>
            <p>Bettapay represents an important milestone in our mission to bring efficiency and transparency to construction operations,” stated Kezya de Bragança, CEO of Bettamint. “We understand the complexities of authenticating and recording construction payments. By integrating precise payment triggers with our platform, we’re ensuring that construction companies only pay for what is due. Bettapay brings a new level of precision and accountability to field operations. It also makes projects more attractive to lenders. Our goal is to empower construction companies to achieve greater operational efficiency, protect margins, reduce financial risks, and deliver projects on time and within budget. In doing so we are also creating an authenticated record of earnings for independent contractor s and workersopening up new doors to affordable finance. It is a win-win for all stakeholders. ”

            </p>
            <p>The launch of Bettapay aligns with the Indian Government's recent directive, reported on 31 January 2024, urging employers to ensure that all wage payments to workers are made digitally. The platform not only simplifies compliance with this directive but also benefits lending institutions and regulatory bodies like RERA by providing a centralized data repository for enhanced project oversight and transparency.
