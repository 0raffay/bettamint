            subscription fee or for the purpose of making any future purchases.</p>
          <h2 class="" id="h-11">11. CHILDREN </h2>

            website please contact us and we will endeavour to delete that
            information from our databases.</p>

            essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations,
            resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can
            vary for different data types and purposes, actual retention periods can
            vary significantly. Even if we delete your Data, it may persist on
            backup or archival media for audit, legal, tax or regulatory purposes. </p>
          <p>We retain account records for six years after expiration or termination

            determine the appropriate retention period for your personal data, we
            consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
            purposes for which we process your personal data, applicable legal
            requirements or operational retention needs, and whether we can achieve
            those purposes through other means.</p>

              data with others, we will tell them about the restriction where
              possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we

              grounds for the processing; or</li>
            <li>ii. if we are processing your personal data for direct marketing. It
              is important that the data we hold about you is accurate and
